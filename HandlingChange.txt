Reasons to change:
- Keeping track of history;
- Slicing and dicing facts across changes;
Slowly changing dimensions
- dimensions change over time in the real world;
- we need to be able to accomodate these slowly changing dimensions over time;
- tracking history and change is utmostly necessary;
- it is unacceptable to put everything in the fact table or make every dimension time-dependent;
- the latter would mean going into a full-blown normalized structure;
- we take advantage of the fact that dimensions are constant over time;
- we only make minor adjustements to contend with the changes;
- we call these constant dimensions slowly changing dimensions (SCDs)

The three types of change (dimension data):
Type 1 (overwriting)
- same as in a transcational environment
- disadvantage of losing history
- used for error correction
- the attribute reflects the newest measurement/ most recent assignment
- fast and easy
- fact table left untouched

Type 2 (new dimension entry)
- preserves history
- is the preferred option
- adds a new row into the dimension
- even if the natural key is the same, the surrogate key will change on the new entry (that's why surrogate keys are a
 brilliant idea)
- the new row automatically partitions history in the fact table;
- perfectly segments the fact table history prechange 
- we can track as many changes as required
- with the type 2 response, we create a new
dimension row with a new single-column primary key to uniquely identify the
new product profile. This single-column primary key establishes the linkage
between the fact and dimension tables for a given set of product characteris-
tics.
- one downisde would be accelerated dimension table growth
- it does not allow association between new entries and old fact history (type 3 solves this);
- valid to and valid from columns can be added to be able to query a valid value in a time span;
Type 3 (maintain both old and new values, add a new dimension column)
- add a new column representing the old value (such as in a prior department for eg when having employees)
- necessary when there is a business need to support two views of the world simultaneously;
- it is barely used, only when the process requires this data to be kept;
- as opposed to a type 2 change, both current and prior values can be regarded as true;
