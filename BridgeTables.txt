Used to build many-to-many relationships between the fact table and a dimension.
Two types of bridge tables:
- The first (easiest to model) is time independent and captures a simple set of values associated with a single fact row. (eg Admittance record in a hospital may have one or more diagnoses associated with it.) - doesn't vary over time
- The second exists independent of the transactions being measured, as it may change over time. (eg A customer can have one or many accounts and an account may belong to one or more customers, but this may not stay the same)

First case
Steps taken to create a bridge table:
1. Historical Load - depends on how the data is captured in the source system, assuming in general that each transaction has a multivalued set of IDs associated with it.
2. Creating the List Of Groups - implies grouping, deduplicating and creating a new table with a group of diagnoses (in this case) and assigning primary keys to each group
3. Creating the Bridge Table - implies unpivoting the un normalized group table, basically assigning each group with its corresponding dimension row. 

Its 3NF counterpart would be the association / junction table used to represent many-to-many relationships in relational database.

A multivalued bridge table may need to be based on a type 2 slowly changing dimension. For example, the bridge table that implements the many-to-many relationship between bank accounts and individual customers usually must be based on type 2 account and customer dimensions.  In this case, to prevent incorrect linkages between accounts and customers, the bridge table must include effective and expiration date/time stamps, and the requesting application must constrain the bridge table to a speciÔ¨Åc moment in time to produce a consistent snapshot.
