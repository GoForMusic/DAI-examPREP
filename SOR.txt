Stimulus Organism Reaction (SOR Model)
STIMULUS:
- Stimulus refers to how our human senses are stimulated in order to attract our attention
- Biases can be generally used to mislead us in terms of how we perceive the information and how our attention is grabbed.
- The way the same data can be visualised in multiple ways can induce different sensations, hence the stimuli are different

ORGANISM:
- When designing for a dashboard, we need to grab the short-term memory of a person through the sensory input, so we have around 7 seconds to do so;
- We need to help encode some of this memory that might be relevant, into the person's long-term memory.
- This can be done through rehearsal, which means it might not necesarrily be our job.
- This is done through grabbing a person's attention.
 

REACTION/RESPONSE:
- when a reaction of any kind takes place, the audience managed to get their attention grabbed.




QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION - Central Tendencies
- Mean: sum of all values / no of all values
- Mode: most frequently occuring value in a set
- Midrange: (highest+lowest)/2 
- Median: middle value from the sorted array of values

QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION - Variations
- Spread: Highest value - lowest value
- Standard Deviation:
	- working out the average
	- for each number subtract the mean and square the result
	- work out the mean of these values
	- take the square root of it and voila!

Preattentive attributes:
- color (hue, intensity, highlighting)
- spatial position (grouping, 2D, 3D positioning)
- form (length, width, size, orientation, curvature, shape)
- motion (induced direction of motion, shadowing, motion blur)

Best value encoding objects:
- Points
- Lines
- Bars
- Boxes

8 types of relationships between data points:
- Nominal Comparison;
- Time Series;
- Ranking;
- Part-to-whole
- Deviation
- Distribution
- Correlation
- Geospatial

15 principles of Dashboard Design:
- Design for a target;
- Keep everything at a glance;
- Keep it simple;
- Align elements;
- Be consistent;
- Highlight the most relevant information;
- Be clear;
- Start from zero;
- Shorten the numbers;
- Show the context;
- Choose the right colors;
- Design dashboards, not reports;
- Show variations;
- Leave background noise off;
- Pick the right chart;
