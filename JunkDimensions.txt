Defined as a collection of attributes that have only a few distinct values
Low cardinality
Creation:
1. Cross joining source tables to get possible value combinations (how to update?)
2. Manually inputting values (how to update with new stuff?)

Incorporating into the fact table to look up the surrogate key.

Reasons: 
- reducing the size of the fact table
- make the dimensional model easier to work with

STEPS:
1. Building the Initial Junk Dimension
	Cross joining the source tables if it wouldn't yield too many rows
	Cross joining based on actual combinations in the fact table, yielding only existing combinations, making it significantly smaller in scale
2. Incorporating the Junk Dimension into the Fact Row Process
	Once set in place, it will be used to look up the surrogate key that corresponds to the combination of attributes found in each fact table source row
3. Maintaining the Junk Dimension
	Checking for new combinations of attributes every time the dimension is loaded.
